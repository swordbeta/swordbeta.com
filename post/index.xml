And are you running Spring web and Spring shell together? I was, perhaps I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t, but that&amp;rsquo;s for later. It was crashing on boot when running through systemd but was working just fine whenever I ran it directly from the terminal.
The only difference being this warning in the logs:

This is why I self-host software on my personal VPS whenever there is a viable self-hosted alternative. This VPS is nothing impressive but does its job well. It runs the latest CentOS on a VPS with 1 vCPU, 2GB of RAM, a 50GB SSD and 2TB of bandwidth costing me about $15 per month (including backups).</description></item><item><title>Hosting H2O Flow and Steam</title><link>https://tricht.dev/post/hosting-h2o-flow-and-steam/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Mar 2018 20:25:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://tricht.dev/post/hosting-h2o-flow-and-steam/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.h2o.ai/">H2O&lt;/a> is an open source machine learning platform. With H2O Flow you&amp;rsquo;re able to train models through a web interface, R or python. With H2O Steam you&amp;rsquo;re able to deploy the trained models, allowing you to call a HTTP endpoint to predict user behavior. Are you planning to host Flow and Steam on your own server? Here are a few things we learned by doing.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Debugging in PhpStorm with Xdebug locally, in Vagrant or in Docker</title><link>https://tricht.dev/post/debugging-in-phpstorm-with-xdebug-locally-in-vagrant-or-in-docker/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Sep 2017 21:33:40 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://tricht.dev/post/debugging-in-phpstorm-with-xdebug-locally-in-vagrant-or-in-docker/</guid><description>&lt;p>Do you use PhpStorm and have you ever wondered what all those fancy debugging features were? Or could you just not get Xdebug running in Docker or your Vagrant machine? Wonder no more!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Using Graylog for logging on Amazon ECS</title><link>https://tricht.dev/post/using-graylog-for-logging-on-amazon-ecs/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jun 2017 21:29:34 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://tricht.dev/post/using-graylog-for-logging-on-amazon-ecs/</guid><description>&lt;p>At work we use &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/">AWS ECS&lt;/a> (Amazon EC2 Container Service) for orchestrating our docker containers. We have a rather small
number of containers running (26~) which all log to &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/">CloudWatch&lt;/a>. Being unsatisfied by the features such as alerting we started looking for a better logging solution.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
